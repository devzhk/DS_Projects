## Dimensionality Reduction
1. Use linear SVM for image classification based on the deep learning features.
2. Reduce the dimensionality of deep learning features using at least three methods (i.e., one feature selection method, one feature projection method, one feature learning method) and perform image classification again based on the obtained low-dimensional features. Record the performance variance w.r.t. different feature dimensionality.
3. Explore the optimal dimensionality reduction method and the optimal dimensionality.
4. The project report should contain experimental setting (i.e., dataset, feature, training/testing split), the dimensionality reduction methods you tried, the experimental results you obtained, and the experimental observations based on your experimental results.
